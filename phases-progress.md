# Kitchen Inventory App - Development Phases & Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation phases for the Kitchen Inventory Desktop application. Each phase builds incrementally toward a production-ready WPF application with MSIX packaging and enterprise-grade reliability.

## Phase 1: Usability and Data Integrity ‚úÖ (IN PROGRESS)
*Enable users to efficiently manage inventory with data validation and intuitive UI.*

### Features
- ‚úÖ **Search/Filter/Sort in Grid**: ICollectionView with real-time filtering by name/unit; sortable columns
- ‚úÖ **Status Bar**: Item counts, filter status, last saved timestamp
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Save Validation**: Disable Save when validation errors exist (PARTIAL - needs validation check)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Culture-Aware Numeric Input**: Quantity input with regex validation (PARTIAL - needs culture formatting)
- üöß **Transactional Stock Movements**: Audit ledger model added and EF migration applied; UI exposure pending
- ‚ùå **DbContext Interceptors**: Enforce Created/Updated timestamps via SaveChanges override
- ‚ùå **Testing Suite**: Unit tests for ViewModels; integration tests with SQLite in-memory; UI smoke tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] User can search by name/unit with real-time filtering
- [x] User can sort by any column (click column headers)
- [x] Status bar shows item counts and filter status
- [ ] Save button disabled when validation errors exist
- [ ] Last saved timestamp displayed in status bar
- [ ] Add/consume/adjust operations create movement records with timestamp/user/reason (model + migration done; runtime logic added; verify via DB)
- [ ] Current stock derived or kept consistent with audit trail
- [ ] Audit trail visible per item

### Recent Changes
- **2024-12-27**: Refined UI layout with toolbar Grid (left actions, right search) and responsive DataGrid sizing
- **2024-12-27**: Added ICollectionView filtering, status bar with counts, search functionality
- **2024-12-27**: Initial MVVM implementation with search/filter capabilities

## Phase 2: Alerts and Catalogs ‚ùå (PLANNED)
*Organize inventory with categories, locations, and proactive alerts.*

### Features
- Item categories and locations for organization
- Unit catalog with conversion rules (kg ‚Üî g, liters ‚Üî ml)
- Low stock thresholds with configurable alerts
- Expiring soon notifications with background timer
- Dedicated alerts pane with badge counts
- CSV import/export with validation preview and error reporting

### Acceptance Criteria
- User can organize items by category and location
- Unit conversions work automatically (e.g., 1.5 kg = 1500 g)
- Low stock alerts appear when quantity falls below threshold
- Expiring items highlighted with days-to-expiry
- CSV export includes all item data; import validates and shows preview
- Import errors downloadable as CSV with issue descriptions

---

## Phase 3: Reporting and Packaging ‚ùå (PLANNED)
*Generate business reports and deploy as professional Windows application.*

### Features
- **Reports**: Stock on hand, low stock, expiring soon, movement history
- **Export Options**: CSV and PDF output for reports
- **MSIX Packaging**: Per-user installation with code signing hooks
- **App Distribution**: winget manifest for Microsoft Store or enterprise deployment
- **Update Channel**: In-app update notifications or MSIX incremental updates

### Acceptance Criteria
- Generate and export stock reports to PDF/CSV
- Build produces installable MSIX package
- App installs per-user under %LocalAppData%\InventoryApp
- App data persists across updates and uninstalls (unless "Reset" chosen)
- Users receive update notifications when new versions available

---

## Phase 4: Reliability and Observability ‚ùå (PLANNED)
*Production-grade monitoring, support, and maintenance capabilities.*

### Features
- **Crash Reporting**: Automatic crash dumps with user consent
- **Support Bundle Export**: Logs, config, and anonymized data for troubleshooting
- **Log Retention**: Structured logging with rotation and cleanup
- **Database Maintenance**: Backup/restore, vacuum, integrity checks
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable beta features per user
- **Telemetry**: Opt-in usage analytics with privacy controls

### Acceptance Criteria
- Crashes automatically generate support bundles
- Users can export diagnostic data for support cases
- Database maintains performance with automatic maintenance
- Beta features can be enabled/disabled without code changes
- Telemetry respects user privacy preferences and GDPR

---

## Phase 5: Security and Multi-User ‚ùå (OPTIONAL)
*Enterprise security and collaboration features based on requirements.*

### Features
- **Authentication**: Local accounts or Active Directory/Azure AD integration
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin/User/ReadOnly permissions
- **Central Synchronization**: Sync to central database or API
- **Conflict Resolution**: Detect and resolve concurrent edit conflicts
- **Audit Compliance**: Full audit trails for regulatory requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
- Users authenticate before accessing application
- Permissions control feature access (add/edit/delete/export)
- Multiple users can work with shared inventory data
- Conflicts resolved through merge strategies or user choice
- All actions logged for compliance and security audits

---

## Next Actions (Immediate)
*Smallest shippable steps with clear acceptance criteria.*

### 1. Complete Phase 1 Search/Filter/Sort
- **Task**: Add LastSavedAt property and update status bar to show timestamp
- **Task**: Implement SaveChangesCommand.CanExecute to check for validation errors
- **Acceptance**: Status bar shows "Last saved: 2024-12-27 14:30" after successful save
- **Acceptance**: Save button disabled when DataGrid has validation errors (red border/tooltip)

### 2. Add Stock Movement Model and Ledger
- **Task**: Create StockMovement entity with ItemId, Type (Add/Consume/Adjust), Quantity, Timestamp, Reason
- **Task**: Update Add/Delete operations to create movement records
- **Acceptance**: Each inventory change creates an audit record
- **Acceptance**: Movement history visible in item details or separate view

### 3. Package as MSIX (Unsigned Dev)
- **Task**: Add MSIX project with manifest and dependencies
- **Task**: Configure build to produce .msix output
- **Acceptance**: Build produces installable MSIX file
- **Acceptance**: App installs per-user and persists data under %LocalAppData%

### 4. CSV Import/Export Foundation
- **Task**: Add Export All Items to CSV functionality
- **Task**: Add Import with validation preview and error reporting
- **Acceptance**: Export creates complete CSV with all item fields
- **Acceptance**: Import shows preview with validation status before committing
