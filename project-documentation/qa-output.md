## Detected Sections (Headings)
- Architecture: School Kitchen Inventory Management — Architecture Blueprint (MVP), Executive Summary, For Backend Engineers (Core Library), For Frontend Engineers (Windows WPF MVP), For QA Engineers, ...
- Product Manager: School Kitchen Inventory Management — Product Manager Output (MVP), Executive Summary, Feature Specifications, Requirements, Decisions, ...

## QA Test Plan (Derived)
- Backend Context: Validate services (InventoryService, CategoryService, NotificationService, AuthService, SettingsService, BackupService, AuditService) with unit tests; enforce validation rules (non-negative quantities, unique category names, password policy, lockout).
- Frontend Context: ViewModel tests for Inventory, ItemDetail, NeedsAttention, Users, Categories; search/filter behavior; sorting; visual cues logic.
- End-to-End Context: Simulate user journeys: login -> inventory -> needs attention -> dismiss -> audit trail; admin user/category management; backup/restore flow.

## TDD Stages
1. Red: Write failing tests that assert outputs include decisions and sections above.
2. Green: Implement minimal parsing and report generation (this stage).
3. Refactor: Improve parsers and structure without changing behavior; keep tests passing.

## CI/CD Enforcement
- dotnet test runs on every push and PR via GitHub Actions.
- Tests must pass for merge; coverage can be added later.
